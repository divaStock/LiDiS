# LiDiS Security Features

LiDiS (Linux Distribution with Integrated Security) is designed from the ground up with advanced security features that go beyond traditional Linux distributions.

## Security Architecture Overview

LiDiS implements a multi-layered security architecture consisting of:

1. **Kernel-Level Security Enhancements**
2. **Real-Time Security Monitoring**
3. **Intelligent Threat Detection**
4. **Automated Response Systems**
5. **Comprehensive System Hardening**

## Kernel-Level Security Features

### 1. Enhanced Control Flow Integrity (CFI)

**Standard Linux CFI Limitations:**
- Forward-edge CFI only for indirect calls
- Limited hardware integration
- Basic protection against ROP/JOP attacks

**LiDiS Enhanced CFI:**
- **Backward-edge CFI**: Protection for return addresses using shadow stacks
- **Fine-grained CFI**: Per-function CFI policies
- **Hardware Integration**: Intel CET and ARM Pointer Authentication support
- **Dynamic CFI**: Runtime CFI policy adaptation

```c
// Example: Enhanced CFI in action
void __attribute__((cfi_canonical_jump_table))
secure_function(void) {
    // Function protected by enhanced CFI
    // Calls verified at runtime
}
```

### 2. Advanced Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR)

**Standard KASLR:**
- Basic kernel text randomization
- Limited entropy
- Vulnerable to information leaks

**LiDiS Advanced KASLR:**
- **Multi-layer randomization**: Text, data, modules, stacks
- **Enhanced entropy**: Hardware random number generator integration
- **Dynamic re-randomization**: Periodic KASLR refresh
- **Leak-resistant**: Protection against KASLR bypass techniques

### 3. Kernel Guard - Runtime Integrity Protection

LiDiS Kernel Guard provides continuous monitoring and protection of critical kernel structures:

- **Code Integrity**: Real-time verification of kernel code sections
- **Data Structure Protection**: Critical kernel data structure monitoring
- **System Call Table Protection**: Prevents syscall table modifications
- **LSM Hook Protection**: Guards Linux Security Module hooks
- **Control Flow Graph Verification**: Runtime CFG validation

```c
struct lidis_kernel_guard {
    u64 code_hash;               // Current kernel code hash
    u64 critical_data_hash;      // Critical data structures hash
    u32 syscall_table_hash;      // System call table hash
    atomic_t violation_count;    // Integrity violation counter
    bool integrity_verified;     // Current integrity status
};
```

### 4. Memory Protection Enhancements
