# LiDiS - Linux Distribution with Integrated Security

**LiDiS** (Linux Distribution with Integrated Security) is a next-generation Linux distribution designed with state-of-the-art security features, advanced kernel security mechanisms, and intelligent threat detection capabilities.

## 🔒 Core Security Features

### Advanced Kernel Security
- **Enhanced CFI (Control Flow Integrity)**: Strict control flow validation beyond standard implementations
- **Advanced KASLR**: Multi-layer address space randomization with enhanced entropy
- **Kernel Guard**: Real-time kernel integrity monitoring and protection
- **Memory Protection**: Advanced SMEP/SMAP with custom extensions
- **Hardware Security Integration**: TPM 2.0, Intel CET, ARM Pointer Authentication

### Integrated Security Systems
- **Real-time IPS**: AI-powered intrusion prevention with behavioral analysis
- **TTP Detection Engine**: MITRE ATT&CK framework-based threat hunting
- **Zero-day Detection**: Machine learning-based vulnerability discovery
- **Threat Intelligence Agent**: Autonomous security intelligence gathering and application
